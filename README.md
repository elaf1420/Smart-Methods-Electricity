## task 1 : The electronic circuit to move the Broch less motor
To provide a control circuit or the like of a brush-less motor capable of properly controlling current of motor windings by detecting positions of magnetic poles of a rotor at a rotational frequency of the rotor from low rotation which cannot lock a PLL circuit to steady-state rotation for rotating at high speed. Positions of magnetic poles are detected by a change in a magnetic flux (magnetic flux signal) of motor windings caused by rotating a rotor having the magnetic poles, thereby, a synchronizing signal (ROT signal) in synchronism with rotation of the rotor is generated. When the rotor is rotated at a low rotational frequency which cannot lock a PLL circuit, the rotor is driven by using predetermined two driving voltage vectors among outputable driving voltage vectors and when a rotational frequency capable of locking the PLL circuit is reached, the rotor is driven by successively outputting the outputable driving voltage vectors in synchronism with the positions of the magnetic poles detecting the outputable driving voltage vectors. Further, the magnetic flux signal is provided by using voltage between two phases at which phases and magnitudes of voltage drop caused by inductances of motor windings are equal to each other.

## Task 2 : Charging and electric power circuits
# Electrical Energy 
is the ability of an electrical circuit to produce work by creating an action. This action can take many forms, such as thermal, electromagnetic, mechanical, electrical, etc. Electrical energy can be both created from batteries, generators, dynamos, and photovoltaics, etc. or stored for future use using fuel cells, batteries, capacitors or magnetic fields, etc. Thus electrical energy can be either created or stored.

We remember from our school science classes that the “The Law of the Conservation of Energy” states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only converted. But for energy to do any useful work it must be converted from one form into something else. For example, a motor converts electrical energy into mechanical or kinetic (rotational) energy, while a generator converts kinetic energy back into electrical energy to power a circuit.

That is electrical machines convert or change energy from one form to another by doing work. Another example is a lamp, light bulb or LED (light emitting diode) which convert electrical energy into light energy and heat (thermal) energy. Then electrical energy is very versatile as it can be easily converted into many other different forms of energy.

For electrical energy to move electrons and produce a flow of current around a circuit, work must be done, that is the electrons must move by some distance through a wire or conductor. The work done is stored in the flow of electrons as energy. Thus “Work” is the name we give to the process of energy.

We can therefore say that Work and Energy are effectively the same as energy can be defined as “the ability to do some work”. Note that work done or energy transferred applies equally to a mechanical system or thermal system as it does to an electrical system. This is because because mechanical, thermal and electrical energies are interchangeable.

# Electrical Energy
The Volt
As we now know that energy is the capacity to do work, with the standard unit used for energy (and work) being the Joule. A joule of energy is defined as the energy expended by one ampere at one volt, moving in one second. Electric current results from the movement of electric charge (electrons) around a circuit, but to move charge from one node to another there needs to be a force to create the work to move the charge, and there is: voltage.

We tend to think of voltage (V) as existing between two different terminals, points or nodes within a circuit or battery supply. But voltage is important as it provides the work needed to move the charge from one point to another, either in a forward direction or a reverse direction. The voltage, or potential difference between two terminals or points is defined as having a value of one volt, when one joule of energy is used in moving one coulomb of electric charge between those two terminals.

In other words, the Voltage difference between two points or terminals is the work required in Joules to move one Coulomb of charge from A to B.
